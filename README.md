# Supply_Chain_Dashboard--Power-BI
This Power BI Supply Chain Dashboard has created as part of my 1-month internship at Unified Mentor. The dashboard provides data-driven insights to optimize supply chain operations by analyzing product performance, supplier efficiency, inventory status, and order fulfillment.

🔹 Project Overview
This Power BI Supply Chain Dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of supply chain performance by examining key aspects such as orders, inventory, product performance, and supplier efficiency.

🔍 Dashboard Sections:

Overview Page: Highlights total orders, total cost, Avg Profit Margin %, stock level, 

Product Page: Focuses on product-wise sales, stock availability, and demand trends.

Supplier Page: Evaluates supplier performance, delivery efficiency, and defect rates.



                    **📊 Insights & Recommendations – Supply Chain Overview Page**

🔍 Key Insights:

1️⃣ Revenue & Products:
Total revenue is 578K, with 4,777 products in stock.
Skincare contributes the highest revenue (241.6K), followed by haircare (174.5K) and cosmetics (161.5K).

2️⃣ Shipping & Transportation:
Shipping costs vary across modes: Road is the most expensive, while Sea is the cheapest.
Carrier B handles the highest revenue (250K), followed by Carrier C (185K) and Carrier A (143K).

3️⃣ Customer Demographics:
Revenue distribution: Female (30%), Male (28%), and the remaining 42% from non-binary & unknown customers.

4️⃣ Product Quality & Supplier Performance:
haircare have the highest defect rate (37%), followed by skincare (35%) and cosmetics (28%).
Supplier 3 has the highest profit margin (91.08%), while others range from 84.11% to 87.24%.

🚀 Recommendations:
✔ Increase inventory for top-selling products (Skincare & Haircare) to meet demand.
✔ Optimize transportation costs by shifting more shipments to sea and air if feasible.
✔ Improve supplier quality control to reduce defect rates, especially for haircare.
✔ Target marketing efforts towards female & male segments since they generate most revenue.
✔ Monitor supplier performance and negotiate better terms with low-margin suppliers.

                          **📊 Insights & Recommendations – Product Page**

🔍 Key Insights:

1️⃣ Top-Selling SKUs:
SKU51 generates the highest revenue (~9,800), with revenue gradually declining for other SKUs.
Profit margin for top SKU6 remains high (~97-98%) but slightly decreases across SKUs.

2️⃣ Stock Levels vs Order Quantity:
Some SKUs have high stock but lower order quantity, indicating overstocking.
Certain SKUs show higher order quantity than stock levels, leading to potential stockouts.

3️⃣ Manufacturing Lead Time:
Haircare products have the longest lead time (~144 days).
Cosmetics have a medium lead time, while Skincare has the shortest.

4️⃣ Profit Margins by Product Type:
Cosmetics, Skincare, and Haircare have similar profit margins (~33-34%), showing a balanced distribution.

🚀 Recommendations:
✔ Optimize inventory levels to match demand, reducing overstocking and preventing stockouts.
✔ Prioritize production for high-demand SKUs with low stock levels to avoid shortages.
✔ Streamline manufacturing lead times, especially for haircare, to improve availability.
✔ Re-evaluate pricing strategies to maximize profit margins, especially for top-performing SKUs.
✔ Monitor slow-moving SKUs and consider promotions or discounts to clear excess stock.

🔍 Key Insights:

1️⃣ Transportation Mode Defect Rates:
Road transport has the highest defect rate (~28.87%), followed by Rail (~25.5%) and Sea (~25%).
Air transport has the lowest defect rate (~20.9%), making it more reliable.

2️⃣ Cost Distribution by Transportation Mode:
Road (31%) and Rail (29%) contribute the highest transportation costs.
Air (27%) is costly but has fewer defects, while Sea (14%) is the cheapest option.

3️⃣ Supplier Cost & Stock Levels:
Supplier 1 has the highest stock level (1,142 units) but also the highest costs.
Supplier 3 has the lowest stock level (654 units), indicating possible supply constraints.

4️⃣ Profit Margin vs. Defect Rate by Supplier:
Some suppliers with high defect rates still have high costs, impacting profitability.
Supplier 1 and Supplier 2 show high costs but moderate margins.

🚀 Recommendations:
✔ Reduce dependence on Road & Rail transport for fragile or high-value products to minimize defects.
✔ Optimize Air & Sea transport usage, balancing cost and defect rates.
✔ Negotiate better pricing with Supplier 1 or switch to cost-effective suppliers with similar stock levels.
✔ Increase orders from Supplier 3 or onboard new suppliers to prevent stock shortages.
✔ Identify high-defect suppliers and implement quality control measures to reduce losses.
